# Hamming Code Implementation

## Description
### This is a simple implementation of Hamming Code in Python.
### The program asks for the number of data bits and calculates the number of redundant bits required to implement Hamming Code.
### It then asks for the data bits and calculates the redundant bits using the standard Hamming Code algorithm.
### The program then asks for the position of the bit to be altered and alters it.
### Finally, it calculates the syndrome and corrects the error, if any.
### The program then displays the original data bits and the corrected data bits.

## Usage
### Run the program using the following command:

```python
python3 main.py
```

# Code
### Importing the required libraries
import math
